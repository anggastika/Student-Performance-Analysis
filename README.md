# Student-Performance-Analysis
This repository contains a statistical learning analysis of some Portuguese students performance, work done for the Data Spaces exam in the Master's Degree at the Politecnico di Torino.

The Dataset can be found at the following link: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Student+Performance

I also want to thank the P. Cortez and A. Silva who wrote the paper 'Using Data Mining to Predict Secondary School Student Performance', which allowed me to find a good starting point for my work and help me to better understand also the social situation.
The work was created using Jupyter Notebook 6.0.3 and as a Python 3.7.6 programming language.
